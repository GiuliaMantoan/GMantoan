I am a Ph.D student in Econometrics at Warwick Business School. My research interests are in forecasting and macroeconomics. In particular, I study density forecasting, its combination, calibration and comunication. My supervisors are Prof. Ana Beatriz Galvao and Prof. James Mitchell. Before starting my Ph.D I did reseach in the private sector, working as Junior Economist at Prometeia SPA, and studied Economics at Caâ€™ Foscari Univeristy in Venice.
