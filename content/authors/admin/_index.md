The one thing you need to know about me is that I am all about predictive distributions: how to estimate them, how to combine and calibrate them, and how to communicate them better. 
Currently, I work at the Bank of England in the Monetary Analysis directorate. Before being a researcher at the Bank, I was a postdoc at the Alan Turing Institute where I collaborated with the ONS - Data Science Campus and an intern at Norges Bank.
I am a proud Ca' Foscari Alumni and a University of Warwick Graduate (where I obtained my PhD in 2021).

Even though this is my website, none of the work you see here could have been possible without the amazing network of researchers I was lucky enough to meet. A non-exhaustive list includes my PhD supervisors James Mitchell and Ana Galvao and my co-authors Knut Are Aastveit, Saskia ter Ellen, Samuel Cohen, Silvia Lui, Lars Nesheim, Aureo de Paula, Lingyi Yang, Roberto Casarin, Francesco Ravazzolo, Simon Lloyd and Ed Manuel.
