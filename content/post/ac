The combination of two or more density forecasts entails a long tradition the
statistics and forecasting literature. However, little attention in econometrics has
been given to the finite mixture distribution as a statistical model for combining
density forecasts. Combination procedures based on a mixture density distribution
are able to account for parameter uncertainty in addition to weights uncertainty,
which are features normally not considered in the traditional \two-step" approaches.
The aim of this paper is to compare the \one-step" mixture approach with a more
traditional \two step" approach for combining density forecasts. The comparison
has been achieved with several Monte Carlo simulations and applications. From
the comparison, the \two-step" set of procedures result to be more accurate in
combining density forecasts when the sample size is small, the individual models
are nonnested or when the number of forecasts to combine is high. The \one-step"
is more accurate in combing density forecasts when the sample size is big enough,
the individual models are nested, when data presents breaks or when the number of
forecasts to combine is low.
