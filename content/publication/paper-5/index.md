abstract: "Both monetary and macroprudential policymakers use conditional density forecasts of
GDP to inform their policy decisions. The former tend to use ‘fan charts’ that convey uncertainty
around central projections from linearised macroeconomic models. The latter draw
on estimates of ‘growth-at-risk’, typically estimated using quantile-regression techniques,
reflecting their focus on the tails of the GDP distribution. Focusing on the UK, we study
how the fan charts constructed by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee compare
to predictive densities derived from statistical growth-at-risk models. We find that
GDP-at-risk models provide improved estimates of the left-tail of the GDP-growth distribution,
in particular at medium-term horizons compared to the GDP fan charts. However,
GDP-at-risk models generally perform worse than the fan charts at the centre of the distribution.
Combining forecast densities in a parsimonious manner provides the best forecasts,
with limited losses compared to optimal density combination methods. Doing so offers
central banks the opportunity to improve GDP density forecasts, and unify the narrative
provided by monetary and macroprudential policymakers about the economic outlook and
uncertainty around it."
